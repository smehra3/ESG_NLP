            "The reassessment process considers whether we have acquired the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. The maximum exposure is equal to the carrying value because we do not have future funding commitments. Under the authoritative guidance we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more_NUMBER_likely_NUMBER_than_NUMBER_not _NUMBER_i.e. These include macro_NUMBER_economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity's operating environment or industry or market considerations; entity_NUMBER_specific events such as increasing costs, declining financial performance, or loss of key personnel; or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers. If it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more_NUMBER_likely_NUMBER_than_NUMBER_not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a two_NUMBER_step impairment test on goodwill. An organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite_NUMBER_lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. Additional amendments to the accounting for income taxes on previously reported quarterly results was the recognition of the windfall tax benefits as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings of   _NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER_ million   together with an increase in deferred tax assets included in other assets of   _NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER_ million  , an increase in additional paid in capital of   _NUMBER__NUMBER_ million  , a reduction in other accrued liabilities of   _NUMBER__NUMBER_ million   and a decrease of   _NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER_ million   in other long term liabilities. Changes in the time value of the foreign exchange contract are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in other income _NUMBER_expense_NUMBER_ each period. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in other income _NUMBER_expense_NUMBER_ over the life of the option contract. On June _NUMBER_, _NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER_, the commitments under the existing credit facility were increased by   _NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER_ million   so that the aggregate commitments under the facility now total   _NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER_ million  . This report contains forward_NUMBER_looking statements including, without limitation, statements regarding trends, seasonality and growth in, and drivers of, the markets we sell into, our strategic direction, our future effective tax rate and tax valuation allowance, earnings from our foreign subsidiaries, lease and site services income from Keysight, the impact of foreign currency movements on our performance, our hedging programs, remediation activities, indemnification, new product and service introductions, the ability of our products to meet market needs, adoption of our products, changes to our manufacturing processes, the use of contract manufacturers, out sourcing and third_NUMBER_party package delivery services, source and supply of materials used in our products, the impact of local government regulations on our ability to pay vendors or conduct operations, our liquidity position and cash availability, our ability to generate cash from operations, growth in our businesses, our investments, including in research and development, the potential impact of adopting new accounting pronouncements, our financial results, our operating margin, our sales, our purchase commitments, our capital expenditures, our contributions to our pension and other defined benefit plans, our strategic initiatives, our cost_NUMBER_control activities and other cost saving initiatives, uncertainties relating to Food and Drug Administration _NUMBER_\"FDA\"_NUMBER_ and other regulatory approvals, the integration of our acquisitions and other transactions, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, write down of investment values or loans and convertible notes, remediation of our material weakness, our stock repurchase program, our declared dividends, our transition to lower_NUMBER_cost regions, and the existence of economic instability, that involve risks and uncertainties. Within the applied markets, and excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, the NMR business and acquisitions, there was strong revenue growth in both the environmental and food markets, but revenue from sales to other applied markets was weak with a decline in revenue from sales to the chemical and energy markets in the   three and nine   months ended   July _NUMBER__NUMBER_, _NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER_  , when compared to the same periods last year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, revenue grew strongly in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology market as well as in the food and environmental markets in the   three and nine   months ended   July _NUMBER__NUMBER_, _NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER_   when compared to the same periods last year.

The decline in the Americas for the three and nine months ended July _NUMBER__NUMBER_, _NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER_ when compared to the same period last year was due to continued weakness in the chemical and energy markets, softness in diagnostic and clinical markets, and the impact of the exiting of the NMR business. Growth in Asia Pacific excluding Japan reflected broad growth in China, particularly in the environmental and food markets. European sales were down on weakness in sales to energy and applied markets. Chemical and energy end_NUMBER_market revenue performance continued to decline in the three and nine months ended July _NUMBER__NUMBER_, _NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER_. Continued government spending in China for environmental initiatives helped drive market performance in the segment. We remain concerned about short term prospects in chemical and energy markets, but are confident in our product portfolio to address customer needs when the market does recover. The food market saw very strong growth and the environmental market saw strong growth for the three months ended July _NUMBER__NUMBER_, _NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER_. The drivers of growth in the short_NUMBER_term and long_NUMBER_term will be our commitment to bring innovative solutions to market and our focus on improving customer experience. We believe our cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and credit lines will satisfy, for at least the next twelve months, our liquidity requirements, both globally and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, business acquisitions, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. On June _NUMBER_, _NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER_, the commitments under the existing credit facility were increased by   _NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER_ million   so that the aggregate commitments under the facility now total   _NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER_ million  . _NUMBER__NUMBER_      Table of Contents  Other       As of July _NUMBER__NUMBER_, _NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER_ our contractual obligations reported under  other purchase commitments   were approximately _NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER_ million, an increase of approximately _NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER_ million in the first nine months of fiscal year _NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER_, largely due to a renewed telecommunications contract together with a long_NUMBER_term support contract related to the purchase of a software license. There were no other substantial changes from our _NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER_ Annual Report on Form _NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER_K to our contractual commitments in the first   nine   months of fiscal _NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER_. We have contractual commitments for non_NUMBER_cancelable operating leases. We have no other material non_NUMBER_cancelable guarantees or commitments. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. While some of the remediation actions are completed, remediation actions will take time to be fully integrated and confirmed to be effective and sustainable. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. In order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non_NUMBER_cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. Some of our products are subject to particularly complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business. Environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm on_NUMBER_site operations and the future use and value of the properties involved, and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future. Certain properties transferred to Keysight Technologies, Inc. _NUMBER_ Keysight _NUMBER_ as part of the separation are undergoing remediation by HP Inc. and Hewlett_NUMBER_Packard Enterprise _NUMBER_formerly Hewlett_NUMBER_Packard Company_NUMBER_ _NUMBER_together \"HP\"_NUMBER_ for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of our separation from HP. HP has agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify Keysight with respect to claims arising out of that contamination. While HP has agreed to minimize interference with on_NUMBER_site operations at those properties, remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require Keysight to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on_NUMBER_site operations and the future use and value of the properties. In addition, the       _NUMBER__NUMBER_      Table of Contents  determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us prior to the separation could involve costly and time_NUMBER_consuming negotiations and litigation. Other than those properties currently undergoing remediation by HP, we have agreed to indemnify HP, with respect to any liability associated with contamination from past operations, and Keysight, with respect to any liability associated with contamination prior to the separation, at, respectively, properties transferred from HP to us and properties transferred by us to Keysight. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential subsurface contamination at any of those properties, subsurface contamination may exist, and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination. Our current and historical manufacturing processes involve, or have involved, the use of substances regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws governing the environment. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination, and these liabilities may be substantial. While we have divested substantially all of our semiconductor related businesses to Avago Technologies Ltd. and Advantest Corporation and regardless of indemnification arrangements with those parties, we may still become subject to liabilities for historical environmental contamination related to those businesses. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the United States, even if the sites outside the United States are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability. As part of our acquisition of Varian, Inc. _NUMBER_ Varian _NUMBER_ we assumed the liabilities of Varian, including Varian's costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters. One such cost is our obligation, along with the obligation of Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. _NUMBER_\"VSEA\"_NUMBER_ to each indemnify Varian Medical Systems, Inc. _NUMBER_ VMS _NUMBER_ for certain costs relating to _NUMBER_a_NUMBER_ environmental investigation, monitoring and/or remediation activities at certain facilities previously operated by Varian Associates, Inc. _NUMBER_\"VAI\"_NUMBER_ and third_NUMBER_party claims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities, and _NUMBER_b_NUMBER_ EPA or third_NUMBER_party claims alleging that VAI or VMS is a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of _NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER_, as amended in connection with certain sites to which VAI allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for recycling, treatment or disposal. Although any ultimate liability arising from environmental_NUMBER_related matters could result in significant expenditures that, if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year, could be material to our financial statements, the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote. Based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental_NUMBER_related events, management believes that the costs of environmental_NUMBER_related matters are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. These assessments can require a high degree of judgment and estimation. Several jurisdictions have granted Agilent tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future. Agilent's taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration. On June _NUMBER_, _NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER_, we increased the commitments under the existing credit facility by _NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER_ million so that the aggregate commitments under the facility now total _NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER_ million and retained a provision that allows us to further increase commitments to the credit facility by _NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER_ million in the aggregate, subject to certain conditions.\n",

Within the applied markets, there was strong revenue growth in the environmental and chemical and energy markets with modest revenue growth in the food market and ongoing declines in the forensics market in the   three and six   months ended   April _NUMBER__NUMBER_, _NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER_  , when compared to the same periods last year. For the three and six months ended April _NUMBER__NUMBER_, _NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER_, revenue grew across nearly all key markets led by strong growth in the diagnostics and clinical, environmental, food and the chemical and energy markets.

For the three months ended April _NUMBER__NUMBER_, _NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER__NUMBER_, end market performance was led by encouraging demand in the chemical and energy markets. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets continued to have solid growth during our second quarter as did environmental sales.
